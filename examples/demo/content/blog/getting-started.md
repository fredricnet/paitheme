# Getting Started with Hugo Modules

This is another example blog post showing the blog layout.

## What are Hugo Modules?

Hugo modules allow you to:

1. Share themes across multiple sites
2. Version your dependencies
3. Update themes easily
4. Avoid file duplication

## Benefits

Using Hugo modules provides many benefits over copying theme files:

- **Centralized updates** - Update one source, apply to all sites
- **Version control** - Pin specific versions or use latest
- **Cleaner repositories** - No theme files in your site repo
- **Easy maintenance** - Update with a single command

This post demonstrates how multiple blog posts are displayed in the blog list view.
