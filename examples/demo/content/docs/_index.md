# Documentation Section

This section demonstrates the **documentation layout** features of PAI Theme, including:

- Sidebar navigation
- Table of contents (TOC)
- Code highlighting
- Nested documentation pages
- Breadcrumb navigation

## Getting Started

This page shows how documentation pages are structured. The theme provides:

1. **Automatic sidebar navigation** based on your content structure
2. **Table of contents** for easy navigation within pages
3. **Code syntax highlighting** for technical documentation
4. **Responsive design** that works on all devices

## Example Code Block

Here's an example of code highlighting:

```yaml
# hugo.yaml
module:
  imports:
    - path: github.com/fredricnet/paitheme
```

The theme automatically highlights code in various languages!

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate between documentation pages. The sidebar automatically builds based on your content structure and weights.
